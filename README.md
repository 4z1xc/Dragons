# Dragons
Adds Dragons and their kin

Plans For the Future:

(* = being worked on)


  Dragons should be a gated experience
  if one decides to find a dragon and allow it's egg to hatch, the dragon will require specific items inorder for it to grow.
    32 of that item
  Green and White Dragon are by far the weakest
  Black, Ancient, or Red Dragon will be strongest, Depends on egg aquisition
  The undead dragon has the lowest health but the 2nd highest damage 
  If the dragon is nuetral, taking it's egg (White) or attaking it will cause it to attack you

  Several Types of Dragons:

    The White Dragon (100hp)
      - A Wyvern
        - Spawns in colder biomes, but not mountains
        - Nuetral dragon
        
    The Red Dragon (140hp)
        - Spawns in mountain biomes, Most in cherry grove
        - Initially Hostile if not crouched
          - requires Valuables to gain it's favor (Maybe a 3, 6, 9)

    The Green Dragon (98hp)
        - Spawns in forest biomes, Most in the Old growth birch forest
        - Hostile if a tree is broken by the player (Through Achivement?)
          - If thats not the case the dragon will be nuetral
            - Not to egg though

    The Blue Dragon (120hp)
        - Spawns in Deep Oceans
          - While it may spawn here, maybe the dragon will leave it's kin in shallower oceans in a ruin.
        - Perma Hostile

    The Ancient Dragon (142hp)
        - Spawns in the Underground layer (Either in the skulk biomes, or in regular caves)
          - If it spawns in the Skulk biomes, It'll make no sound so the warden will always be passive to it
            - It could also act like the warden where it's blind but has great ears.
              - Perma Hostile
          - If it spawns in regular caves it may be seen fighting the warden (maybe the same health as the warden)
            - Nuetral

    The Black Dragon (150hp)
        -spawns in the End
          - the black dragon is the kin of the ender dragon
            - the dragon egg upon defeating the dragon will become the next ender dragon (In name). The black dragons we born during her rain
            -Perma Hostile if the Ender Dragon is defeated(you killed their mother... duh)

    The Undead Dragon (50hp)
        -spawns in the Nether
          -is friend
            - has no egg but can be "tamed"

  Kobolds
  
    -Short and Chubby (15hp)
      - lower chance to spawn 
      - can't spawn with Red and Anicent Dragon colors
      - can only spawn in overworld

    -Tall and Skinny (10hp)
      - will spawn more often
      - can only spawn in the overwold
